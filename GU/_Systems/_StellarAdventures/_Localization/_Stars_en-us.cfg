		#LOC_GU_Stars_WISE0855-0714_displayName = LONE 0855-0714^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_WISE0855-0714_description = LONE 0855-0714 is a sub-brown dwarf, essentially a lone gas giant in the void of space. It is roughly 3-10 Jool Masses, and is unable to support fusion of any kind. A truly failed star, it is unable to be classified as a brown dwarf, and is thought to have been ejected from its solar system. Interestingly, after close infrared observation, it's thought that LONE 0855-0714 has clouds of water vapor, making it a tantalizing candidate for closer observation. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to WISE0855-0714.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_Wolf359_displayName = Virg 359^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_Wolf359_description = Virg 359 is the 7th closest star to Kerbol, at a distance of 7.86 light years. It's a red dwarf, at 9% of the sun's mass, making it an extremely light true star. It only has 1% the luminosity of Kerbol, and is at the lower limit of what could be considered a star. Any lower than this, and the star would be considered a heavy brown dwarf. The outer atmosphere of this star is sufficiently cool enough for plasma to cool into gases, with Carbon Monoxide, Iron Hydride, Chromium Hydride, and Water being notable portions of Virg 359's atmosphere. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Wolf 359.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_Lalande21185_displayName = Denalan 21185^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_Lalande21185_description = Denalan 21185 is the brightest red dwarf in the sky. However, as is the case with all red dwarves, it is still unable to be seen with the unaided eye. It is 0.46 kerbol Masses, placing it on the higher end for M-Type main sequence stars. While currently at 8.31 light years, in 19.900 years, it will reach its closest position to Kerbol at 4.65 light years, at which point it will become the fourth closest star.  <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Lalande 21185.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_Luyten726-8-A_displayName = Laythen 726-8 A^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_Luyten726-8-A_description = Laythen 726-8 A is the primary in the Laythen 726-8 system. It's an M-type main sequence star, and is known to undergo extremely quick changes in brightness. As the archetype for what is considered a flare star, this star's luminosity and magnetic output can change very rapidly and erratically, causing massive change within the star system in mere minutes. As the basis for all other flare stars, Laythen 726-8 A is certainly worth a closer inspection. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Luyten 726-8 A.</color>
		
		#LOC_GU_Stars_Luyten726-8-B_displayName = Laythen 726-8 B^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_Luyten726-8-B_description = Laythen 726-8 B, is the secondary star in the Laythen 726-8 system. Only slightly smaller than its primary, Laythen 726-8 B is certainly a good place to have a closer look at this system without having to deal with the rapid changes brought on by Laythen 726-8 A's sudden temper tantrums. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Luyten 726-8 B.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_Lacaille9352_displayName = Lecaylle-9352^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_Lacaille9352_description = Lecaylle-9352 is a small star roughly 10.74 light years from Kerbol. It's an average M-type star, at .48 solar masses. It's rather uninteresting, although it does have the fourth highest proper motion of any observed star. It's closest neighbor is the SC Aquell system, so, despite its uninteresting stature, perhaps it would be a good jumping off point for further exploration into deep space. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Lacaille 9352.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_Ross154_displayName = Surr 154^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_Ross154_description = Surr 154 is another small red dwarf, weighing in only at 0.17 solar masses. As is typical for such small stars, Surr 154 is a flare star, undergoing extremely rapid shifts in luminosity at random intervals. Surr 154 is interesting in that it has no Stars, nor evidence of Stars. There's nothing to suggest that there's a stellar debris disk in which protoStars could have formed, nor remnants of planetary debris. Truly, Surr 154 is a lonely star in the cosmos. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Ross 154.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_Ross248_displayName = Surr 248^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_Ross248_description = Surr 248 is an extremely small star. At only 0.12 solar masses, Surr 248 is near the lower end of what could be considered a red dwarf star. Surr 248, like so many other tiny red dwarves, is a flare star, changing up to 10 magnitudes in a matter of minutes. Surr 248 will actually become the closest star to Kerbin in roughly 80,000 years, surpassing the current record holder Proksimus Kirbani, at only 3 light years. Even at its closest, however, Surr 248 will still be too dim to see with the naked eye. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Ross 248.</color>

		
		#LOC_GU_Stars_61CygniA_displayName = Signar A^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_61CygniA_description = Signar A is the primary star in the 61 Signar system. A K-class, this star is slightly smaller than Kerbol, at 0.7 solar masses. At 10.4 lightyears from Kerbol, it's a rather distant star. This, combined with its rather low luminosity, makes it rather dim and hard to see from Kerbin. It gained notoriety when both it and 61 Signar B were discovered to have a rather high proper. Despite being part of a binary system, 61 Signar A and B are extremely distant, orbiting one another once every 659 years. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to 61 Cygni A.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_61CygniB_displayName = Signar B^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_61CygniB_description = Signar B is the secondary in the 61 Signar system. At .63 solar masses, it classifies as a low-class K-type star. Known for it and its partner's high proper motion, 61 Signar B also maintains a rather distant orbit around its primary, orbiting once every 659 years. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to 61 Cygni B.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_ProcyonA_displayName = Proksion A^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_ProcyonA_description = Proksion A is a rather rare star in the sky. It's an F5V-type star, meaning it's bright, large, and old. At 1.5 solar masses, Proksion A is roughly 2.5 times as bright as our sun, and is nearing the end of its life. It's a late-stage star, meaning that it is almost finished fusing hydrogen, and is beginning to fuse primarily helium. As such, it is beginning to evolve into a subgiant. Luckily, this won't happen for millions, if not a billion or more years. While we wait for our inevitable extinction, surveying Proksion A would be a great opportunity to see an aging star up close. So hurry up! Time is wasting! <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Procyon A.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_ProcyonB_displayName = Proksion B^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_ProcyonB_description = Proksion B is like a glimpse into the future of Proksion A. Proksion B is a white dwarf weighing in at .6 solar masses. If it were a normal star, this would easily put it in K-type range. However, Proksion B is at the end of its lifespan. It no longer fuses elements, and instead is an iron ball slowly radiating heat out into the void. In hundreds of billions, neigh trillions of years, Proksion B will eventually become a black dwarf; a dark, dead ball of iron floating through the void. This is the same fate that Proksion A will eventually face, but for now, Proksion A lives. Survey Proksion B, and perhaps you could get a glimpse into the future. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Procyon B.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_EpsilonIndiA_displayName = Kespilon Yndi A^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_EpsilonIndiA_description = Kespilon Yndi A is the primary star in the Kespilon Yndi system. As a K-type main sequence star, Kespilon Yndi A is roughly 75% the mass of Kerbol, and as such radiates an orange-yellow glow. However, despite a smaller mass than our star, Kespilon Yndi A is theorized to actually have a higher surface gravity; a strange twist of irony. According to observations, it's theorized that Kespilon Yndi A has at least 1 planet; a super-Jool with 3.25 Jool masses. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Epsilon Indi A.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_EpsilonIndiBa_displayName = Kespilon Yndi Ba^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_EpsilonIndiBa_description = Kespilon Yndi Ba is the middle child of the Kespilon Yndi system. A brown dwarf around 69 Jool Masses, Kespilon Yndi Ba is near the transition between a T and an L-class brown dwarf; almost able to maintain deuterium fusion. However, despite being close to this transition, Kespilon Yndi Ba is still too small to maintain fusion on its own, and as such is still just a cold, failed star. What is worth note, however, is its partner, Kespilon Yndi Bb. These two stars form a binary pair, which in turn orbits Kespilon Yndi A at the staggering distance of 1.5 thousand KAU. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Epsilon Indi Ba.</color>
		
		#LOC_GU_Stars_EpsilonIndiBb_displayName = Kespilon Yndi Bb^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_EpsilonIndiBb_description = Kespilon Yndi Bb is the smallest star in the Kespilon Yndi system. As a T-6 brown dwarf, Kespilon Yndi Bb is closer to a massive gas giant than a star. Barely radiating any heat at all, it orbits it's bigger brother Kespilon Yndi Ba at around 2.1 KAU, with an orbital period of 15 years. At only 49 Jool Masses, it is far outweighed by its larger twin. Despite its seemingly boring nature, its mere position as part of a binary within a larger trinary system makes it a much desired destination. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Epsilon Indi Bb.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_KapetynsStar_displayName = Keptan's Star^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_KapetynsStar_description = Keptan's Star is a rather unique star. It's an M-type red subdwarf. While it has a mass of 0.25 solar masses, it only has 1.2% of Kerbol's luminosity. This is caused by an abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, meaning the star has less fusion activity. As a result, it has been around for an incredibly long time; around 11 billion years. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Kapteyn's Star.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_DENISP_displayName = DENIS-P^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_DENISP_description = Denis-P is one of the smallest stellar objects discovered, at roughly 10% the mass of Kerbol. It is so small, in fact, that there is an ongoing debate in the scientific community over whether or not it’s a small star or a large brown dwarf. Studying Denis-P would allow more insight into the classification of a star. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to DENIS-P.</color>

 		#LOC_GU_Stars_VanMaanen2_displayName = Van Neeren 2^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_VanMaanen2_description = Van Neeren 2 is a solitary stellar remnant, that is, a white dwarf. It was the first of its kind to be discovered, and while 68% of Kerbol's mass, it is only 1% of its radius. It maintains a luminosity of 0.00017 times that of our sun. It's relatively close to home, as well, at only 14 light years. It could potentially be a great place to explore one day. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Van Maanen 2.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_DXKrian_displayName  = DX Krian^N
           	#LOC_GU_Stars_DXKrian_description = TBA
		

		#LOC_GU_Stars_40Eridani_displayName = 40 Kirilani^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_40Eridani_description = TBA

		#LOC_GU_Stars_40EridaniB_displayName = 40 Kirilani B^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_40EridaniB_description = TBA

		#LOC_GU_Stars_40EridaniC_displayName = 40 Kirilani C^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_40EridaniC_description = TBA


		#LOC_GU_Stars_Altair_displayName = Lataire^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_Altair_description = Lataire is a large A-type main sequence star. At 1.8 solar masses, it's one of the brightest stars in the sky, and is known for its position in constellations. Lataire spins extraordinarily fast, to the point that is not actually a sphere, but in fact is ovular; it's flattened at the poles, and its equator bulges outward. This rotational speed was confirmed via direct imaging, the first time such a method was successfully used on a main-sequence star. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Altair.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_Gliese581_displayName = Glize 581^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_Gliese581_description = Glize 581 is a relatively small M-class red dwarf, weighing in at a meager .31 solar masses. It's rather unassuming, being just another red dwarf out of many. However, this star is also what is known as a variable star. While it normally has a luminosity of just 1.3% of that of Kerbol, it can randomly increase its brightness by 1%, effectively doubling its luminosity for brief periods. Scientists are scrambling to get a closer look at this dull, but still interesting star. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Gliese 581.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_61Virginis_displayName = 61 Rigilis^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_61Virginis_description = 61 Rigilis is a G-type star ever so slightly smaller than our own, at 0.93 solar masses. It is incredibly similar to our sun, to the point that many scientists refer to the two stars as twins. However, it is older than our sun, at 6.1 billion years old compared to Kerbol's 4.5 billion years of existence. Despite this, many would love to get a closer look at a star so similar to our own. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to 61 Virginis.</color>
		
		#LOC_GU_Stars_DeltaEridani_displayName = Linus Kirilani^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_DeltaEridani_description = Linus Kirilani is a large star that is somewhat visible to the naked eye. It's interesting in the sense that it has exhausted almost all of its hydrogen and is in the beginning stages of swelling up to become a red giant, much like Kerbol will in a few billion years. Linus Kirilani is sometimes referred to as the "frog star" among certain groups of scientists, yet no one really knows why it's called that. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Delta Eridani.</color>
		
		#LOC_GU_Stars_UpsilonAndromedaeA_displayName = Ospilon Indromida A ^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_UpsilonAndromedaeA_description = Ospilon Indromida A is a rather large star. At 1.2 solar masses, it is classified as an F-type main sequence star. It's younger, hotter, and more massive than our sun. At 3.1 billion years old, it's like the energetic younger brother to Kerbol. It's roughly halfway through its life, despite being much younger than our sun, as this star, as is the case with larger stars, runs through its nuclear fuel much faster. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Upsilon Arndromedae A.</color>
	
		#LOC_GU_Stars_UpsilonAndromedaeB_displayName = Ospilon Indromida B ^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_UpsilonAndromedaeB_description = Ospilon Indromida is a rather large star. At 1.2 solar masses, it is classified as an F-type main sequence star. It’s younger, hotter, and more massive than our sun. At 3.1 billion years old, it’s like the energetic younger brother to Kerbol. It’s roughly halfway through its life, despite being much younger than our sun, as this star, as is the case with larger stars, runs through its nuclear fuel much faster. It’s unclear exactly what may be around this star. In the past, it was theorized that it had a binary partner; however, this was disproven. Perhaps getting a closer look at this middle-aged star would provide some insight? <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Upsilon Arndromedae B.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_SigmaDraconis_displayName = Seta Drakaris^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_SigmaDraconis_description = Seta Drakaris is a main sequence K-type star at a moderate distance from Kerbol. While the star isn’t as massive as Kerbol, sitting at about 0.85 solar masses, it is a much better star for colonization efforts due to its low amount of radiation and long lifespan. However, there is no evidence of planets detected yet. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Sigma Draconis.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_82GKerilani_displayName = 82 G. Kirilani^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_82GKerilani_description = 82 G. Kirilani is an average star at a moderate distance from Kerbol. The star is only slightly smaller than Kerbol, and is a G6 type star, just slightly dimmer. 82 G. Kirilani is well known for its high velocity and its proposed status as a population II star, or a star that formed outside the galactic disk. This would explain the metal-poor composition of the star. 82 G. Kirilani is also believed to have planets, yet none have been confirmed so far. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to 82 G. Eridani.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_OTS44_displayName = URS44^N
       		#LOC_GU_Stars_OTS44_description = URS 44 is a large brown dwarf located in Kerbin's southern hemisphere. Upon its discovery, scientists found that the brown dwarf possesses a large debri disk that extends far beyond the brown dwarf itself. The presence of a debri disk this dense is fairly rare among stellar or even substellar objects due to their short-lived nature and tendencies to form into planets. This makes URS 44 an attractive destination to learn more about planet formation. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to OTS 44.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_Arcturus_displayName = Carvanis^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_Arcturus_description = Carvanis is one of the brightest stars seen in the night sky, despite its distance from Kerbin. The star is a K0III type star, meaning it is an orange giant many times the size of Kerbol, even though the two stars have a similar mass. The study of Carvanis may provide some insight into the future of Kerbol and its planets billions of years from now. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Arcturus.</color>
		
		#LOC_GU_Stars_Bellatrix_displayName = Sorionix^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_Bellatrix_description = Sorionix, not to be confused with a character in a popular novel of a wizard boy, is a bright B-type star at 8.5 solar masses. Despite its young age, only 25 million years old, the star is beginning to exhaust its hydrogen supply and will soon expand into a giant. Regardless of its age, the presence of B-type stars near Kerbol are very rare, making the exploration of Sorionix well received, even if only for a flyby. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Bellatrix.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_Fomalhaut_displayName = Autarsis^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_Fomalhaut_description = Autarsis is a bright A-type star in Kerbin's southern hemisphere. At about 1.9 solar masses, the star sticks out in its region in the night sky. Autarsis is well known for its large debri disk, which has been studied as much as possible with current technology. Large telescopes were even able to photograph the disk, despite its distance. Properties like this make Autarsis a candidate for potential planets, which are fairly uncommon around stars of its type. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Fomalhaut.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_V1400CentauriB_displayName = Mamajeb's Object^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_V1400CentauriB_description = MamaJeb's object is the sole planet orbiting V1400 Kirbani. While the planet itself doesn’t seem extremely appealing, it has one of the most massive ring systems ever discovered. MamaJeb’s Object’s ring system is so massive, in fact, that it can be easily seen without aid from the other side of its orbit. While this ring system is likely to be only temporary as the planet is still forming, it makes for some of the most impressive views of the planet, as well as an amazing place to mine raw material. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Mamajek's Object.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_V1400CentauriA_displayName = V1400 Kirbani A^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_V1400CentauriA_description = V1400 Kirbani is a distant star not too different from Kerbol. It is a K5 main sequence star, with a mass roughly 90% of our own star. Unlike Kerbol, it is a very young star, with an estimated age of roughly 16 million years. Its system is still forming, meaning that there is a dense halo of gas, dust, and other particles filling an otherwise empty void. V1400 Kirbani is a great place to learn about still-forming star systems. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to V1400 Centauri.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_PolarisAa_displayName = Arceus Minor Aa^N
        	#LOC_GU_Stars_PolarisAa_description = Arceus Minor is well known for being the "north star", or the star that hangs right above the north pole of Kerbin. This gives it the appearance of it staying in one place as Kerbin rotates. This behavior has made Arceus Minor one of the most well known stars, and has made it not only an easily recognizable object, but also a useful star for navigation, both on the surface and in space. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Polaris Aa.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_PolarisAb_displayName = Arceus Minor Ab^N
        	#LOC_GU_Stars_PolarisAb_description = Arceus Minor Ab was the last star discovered around Arceus Minor due to it being so close to Aa. Despite being larger and brighter than Kerbol, Arceus Minor Ab is constantly being outshined by the massive Arceus Minor Aa. Despite this, F-type stars are fairly uncommon in the local area, so learning about such a star, especially in a unique star system, is a great idea. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Polaris Ab.</color>
		
		#LOC_GU_Stars_PolarisB_displayName = Arceus Minor B^N
        	#LOC_GU_Stars_PolarisB_description = Initially to be a separate but nearby star, Arceus Minor B is a distant star locked into a binary with Arceus Minor Aa and Ab. Like the other two stars, it is a main sequence F-type star slightly larger than Kerbol. Being the first binary star discovered, Arceus Minor B was a major component in the study of stars, and even planets, beyond our own. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Polaris B.</color>
