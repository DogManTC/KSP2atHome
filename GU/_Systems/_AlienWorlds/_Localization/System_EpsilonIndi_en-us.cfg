	#LOC_GU_Stars_EpsilonIndiA_displayName = Kespilon Yndi A^N
	#LOC_GU_Stars_EpsilonIndiA_description = Kespilon Yndi A is the primary star in the Kespilon Yndi system. As a K-type main sequence star, Kespilon Yndi A is roughly 75% the mass of Kerbol, and as such radiates an orange-yellow glow. However, despite a smaller mass than our star, Kespilon Yndi A is theorized to actually have a higher surface gravity; a strange twist of irony. According to observations, it's theorized that Kespilon Yndi A has at least 1 planet; a super-Jool with 3.25 Jool masses. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Epsilon Indi A.</color>

	#LOC_GU_Stars_EpsilonIndiBa_displayName = Kespilon Yndi Ba^N
	#LOC_GU_Stars_EpsilonIndiBa_description = Kespilon Yndi Ba is the middle child of the Kespilon Yndi system. A brown dwarf around 69 Jool Masses, Kespilon Yndi Ba is near the transition between a T and an L-class brown dwarf; almost able to maintain deuterium fusion. However, despite being close to this transition, Kespilon Yndi Ba is still too small to maintain fusion on its own, and as such is still just a cold, failed star. What is worth note, however, is its partner, Kespilon Yndi Bb. These two stars form a binary pair, which in turn orbits Kespilon Yndi A at the staggering distance of 1.5 thousand KAU. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Epsilon Indi Ba.</color>
		
	#LOC_GU_Stars_EpsilonIndiBb_displayName = Kespilon Yndi Bb^N
	#LOC_GU_Stars_EpsilonIndiBb_description = Kespilon Yndi Bb is the smallest star in the Kespilon Yndi system. As a T-6 brown dwarf, Kespilon Yndi Bb is closer to a massive gas giant than a star. Barely radiating any heat at all, it orbits it's bigger brother Kespilon Yndi Ba at around 2.1 KAU, with an orbital period of 15 years. At only 49 Jool Masses, it is far outweighed by its larger twin. Despite its seemingly boring nature, its mere position as part of a binary within a larger trinary system makes it a much desired destination. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Epsilon Indi Bb.</color>
	
	#LOC_GU_Planets_Herculeon_displayName = Herculeon^N
	#LOC_GU_Planets_Herculeon_description = Love swimming? If so, then planet Herculeon is the perfect vacation spot for you and your kerbal friends. It's worldwide ocean is a great place to captain a ship or to build a floating base, and its plentiful marine life is enough to keep most divers entertained. Just don't swim with a full stomach, and you'll do fine on this watery world.
	#LOC_GU_Planets_Herculeon_BiomeName1 = Polar Oceans
	#LOC_GU_Planets_Herculeon_BiomeName2 = Temperate Oceans
	#LOC_GU_Planets_Herculeon_BiomeName3 = Equatorial Oceans

	#LOC_GU_BaryCenters_EpsilonIndiBarycenter_displayName = Epsilon Indi A-Ba/Bb Barycenter^N
	#LOC_GU_BaryCenters_EpsilonIndiBarycenter_description = The center of mass of Epsilon Indi A and Ba-Bb, all objects orbit around this point in space.

	#LOC_GU_BaryCenters_EpsilonIndiBarycenter-1_displayName = Epsilon Indi Ba-Bb Barycenter^N
	#LOC_GU_BaryCenters_EpsilonIndiBarycenter-1_description = The center of mass of Epsilon Indi Ba and Bb, both objects orbit around this point in space.
