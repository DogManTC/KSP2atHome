		#LOC_GU_Stars_Ross128_displayName = Surr 128^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_Ross128_description = Surr 128 is a mid-range red dwarf, with about 0.15 solar masses to its name. Surr 128 is a relatively calm red dwarf. While it still outputs large and incredibly powerful flares, they are few and far between. Surr 128 is also orbited by a large dust cloud, which was discovered after astronomers noticed a distinct infrared excess around the star. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Ross 128.</color>

	#LOC_GU_Planets_Ilos_displayName = Ilos^N
        #LOC_GU_Planets_Ilos_description = Ilos is a very interesting oceanic/marine planet, with a few continents on its surface. It is very similar to Ilos, and has a very distinct yellowed hue to its atmosphere, due to the light exerted from its parent star. Ilos seems to have the potential to host life on its surface, and many kerbals are excited to find out if it does. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Ross 128 b.</color>
