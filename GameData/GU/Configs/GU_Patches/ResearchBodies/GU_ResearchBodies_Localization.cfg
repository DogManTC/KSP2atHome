		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_ProximaCentauri = Proksimus Kirbani, or Nova Kirbani C, is an M-type red dwarf and is the nearest star to Kerbol. The spectral "class" of a star does not represent its size, rather its color and chemical properties.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Alva = A planet slightly smaller than Kerbin has just transited across Nova Kirbani A. It appears to be just outside the habitable zone, so it could be possible the planet had water.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Blalo = A planet slightly larger than Kerbin has been discovered orbiting Nova Kirbani A. Due to its proximity to Nova Kirbani A, it might have oceans and maybe even life.

		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Mau = What appears to be a large asteroid has transited Seirios B. It may be worth visiting.

		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Luyten726-8-B = Laythen 726-8 B, also known as UV Turi, is, like its sibling, a flare star. Other flare stars, such as Proksimus Kirbani, are actually referred to as UV Turi stars.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Ross248 = Surr 248 is a small flare star like most red dwarves, with roughly 14% of Kerbol's mass. It will actually become the closest star to Kerbol in 80,000 years, at a distance of 3 light-years.

		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Frigg = We have discovered a moon in a distant orbit around Ael. Ael's gravity is still strong enough to cause tidal forces on it, which could lead to interesting geological properties.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Tias = Our astronomers have identified a ringed ice giant orbiting far away from Kespilon Kirilani. It may be an interesting place to visit.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Fen = Interesting. There appears to be a moon in polar orbit of Tias, which may actually take it beyond the boundary of Tias' ring system. The circumstances of its formation should be investigated.

		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_TauCeti = Cer Turi is a G-type star, like Kerbol. However, it is smaller. It could be a good place to look for extraterrestrial life.

		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_KapetynsStar = Kapetyn's Star is a red subdwarf: not a red dwarf, but not a white dwarf. It is incredibly old due to a reduced amount of fuel for its fusion reaction, which is also the reason for its unique classification.

		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_OTS44 = OTS44 is a small dwarf star surrounded by a massive accretion disk which could develop into a planetary system.

		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Dragûr = Our astronomers appear to have discovered a planet orbiting the pulsar Leethe. The neutron radiation from Leethe may threaten our spacecraft, but, as a world around an exotic star, exploration may be worth the risk.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Polter = We have discovered a large planet with a dense atmosphere orbiting around Leethe. It is likely a super-Kerbin, and is unlikely to harbor life.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Phobor = We have found a planet orbiting Leethe. It appears to be massive, and is likely dense based on gravitational perturbations in Polter's orbit. It also appears to have a thin atmosphere.

		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_SgrA = We have conclusively determined that the radio source Kax A* is, in fact, a supermassive black hole. Not even light can escape, once it passes beyond the event horizon. It is certainly worth exploring.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_TheAll = Implausibly, something appears to be orbiting around Kax A*. We have no idea what it is - or any ideas what it could be. Its properties do not match those of any known celestial body.
