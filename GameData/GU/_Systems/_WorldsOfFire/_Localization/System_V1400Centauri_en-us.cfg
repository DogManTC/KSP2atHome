		#LOC_GU_Stars_V1400CentauriA_displayName = V1400 Kirbani A^N
        	#LOC_GU_Stars_V1400CentauriA_description = V1400 Kirbani is a distant star not too different from Kerbol. It is a K5 main sequence star, with a mass roughly 90% of our own star. Unlike Kerbol, it is a very young star, with an estimated age of roughly 16 million years. Its system is still forming, meaning that there is a dense halo of gas, dust, and other particles filling an otherwise empty void. V1400 Kirbani is a great place to learn about still-forming star systems.

		#LOC_GU_Stars_V1400CentauriB_displayName = MamaJeb's Object^N
        	#LOC_GU_Stars_V1400CentauriB_description = MamaJeb's Object is the sole planet orbiting V1400 Kirbani. While the planet itself doesn't seem extremely appealing, it has one of the most massive ring systems ever discovered. MamaJeb's Object's ring system is so massive, in fact, that it can be easily seen without aid from the other side of its orbit. While this ring system is likely to be only temporary as the planet is still forming, it makes for some of the most impressive views of the planet, as well as an amazing place to mine raw material.

		#LOC_GU_Planets_Artavis_description = A young, fiery moon in the outskirts of known space, Artavis maintains a close rather close orbit inside the huge rings of Mamajeb's Object. It is assumed Artavis is rich in unique and valuable minerals which could be mined by future colonists.
