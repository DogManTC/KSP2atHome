//Textures were created by StarCrusher96 with the use of Adobe Photoshop. These textures fall under the mod's //license and NO permission is given to use this content for other purposes other than Galaxies Unbound.

//*For GU, no Space Engine textures were used (this is not a bad thing though). Telling otherwise is complete //bullshit.

//*IF however you think we used licensed content and this hasn't been mentioned by me (StarCrusher96). Please //do report this and I'll fix this asap. Talking behind my back about it doesn't solve anything. 

//*The textures have hidden markers, so do have the configs. So using parts of it will be noticed. Try to be original and don't make knockoff worlds.

//Thx in advance and enjoy.
