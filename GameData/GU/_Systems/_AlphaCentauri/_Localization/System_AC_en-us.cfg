		#LOC_GU_Stars_AlphaCentauriA_displayName = Nova Kirbani A^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_AlphaCentauriA_description = Nova Kirbani A is a G-type star and the largest in the Nova Kirbani System, a ternary system of 3 stars that make up the closest star system to the Sun. Nova Kirbani is regarded as a promising destination for the new yet eager traveller. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Alpha Centauri A / Rigel Centaurus A.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_AlphaCentauriB_displayName = Nova Kirbani B^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_AlphaCentauriB_description = Nova Kirbani B is the second of the stars in the Nova Kirbani, and is massive enough to turn it into a binary with Nova Kirbani A. Being a high K-type star, it is one of the calmer stars out in space, and even hosts a few planets of its own. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Alpha Centauri B / Rigel Centaurus B.</color>

		#LOC_GU_Stars_Proxima_displayName = Proksimus Kirbani^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_Proxima_description = Proksimus Kirbani is the smallest of the stars in the Nova Kirbani System. It's well known for being the closest star to Sun. While this little M-type star is often seen as the runt of the 3 stars, it is home to some promising new worlds to explore. <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Proxima Centauri.</color>

		#LOC_GU_BaryCenters_AlphaCentauri_displayName = Nova Kirbani Barycenter^N
		#LOC_GU_BaryCenters_AlphaCentauri_description = The center of mass of Nova Kirbani A and B, both stars orbit around this point in space.

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Alva.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Alva_displayName = Alva^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Alva_description = Being so close to Nova Kirbani A, Alva receives more than its fair share of radiation from the star. Scientists believe that Alva may have once been much more Kerbin-like in the past, but eventually got too close to Nova Kirbani A to keep its oceans liquid. It now sits as a hostile desert world that will give a glimpse into the future of Kerbin.

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Blalo.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Blalo_displayName = Blalo^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Blalo_description = Blalo is regarded as a jewel in an otherwise desolate star system. It is one of the most Kerbin-like worlds discovered, albeit with a slightly higher gravity and colder temperatures. Blalo is a prime destination for the aspiring colonist to explore its balmy grasslands and seas.
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Blalo_BiomeName1 = Tundra
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Blalo_BiomeName2 = Grasslands

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Ito/NK.C-01.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Ito_displayName = Ito^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Ito_description = Ito is a tiny moon that orbits alarmingly close to Blalo. The moon is responsible for being a shepherd to the thin rings that orbit the planet. While scientists are certain that there is no way Ito could impact Blalo soon, they do assure that the little moon provides an amazing view of the planet!
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Ito_BiomeName1 = Polar Areas

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Leyn.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Leyn_displayName = Leyn^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Leyn_description = Leyn is the closest major moon to Blalo, and is most well known for the spectacular views it has of the planet. Leyn's surface is believed to be younger than the other moons, with craters believed to have originated from the same event that created Blalo's impact basin. Visiting Leyn could help scientists to learn more about Blalo's history.
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Leyn_BiomeName1 = Lowlands

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Rav.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Rav_displayName = Rav^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Rav_description = Rav is the smallest moon orbiting Blalo. However, Rav is also home to one of the largest impact craters relative to itself. Rav's main crater covers almost an entire hemisphere, leading scientists to wonder how this little moon has had such a violent past.
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Rav_BiomeName1 = Giant Impact Basin
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Rav_BiomeName2 = Impact Crater 1
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Rav_BiomeName3 = Highlands

		#LOC_GU_Planets_Rav_BiomeName5 = Lowlands

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Alar.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Alar_displayName = Alar^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Alar_description = Alar is the largest moon found around Blalo. While the moon looks rather dull and doesn't provide views as spectacular as Leyn or Rav, this moon is vital to the Blalean planetary system because it will deflect or consume any rogue asteroids potentially wiping out life on Blalo.
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Alar_BiomeName1 = Giant Impact Basins
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Alar_BiomeName2 = Medium Sized Impact Basins
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Alar_BiomeName3 = Lesser Impact Basins

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Orus.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Orus_displayName = Orus^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Orus_description = Orus is a large icy planet orbiting far from Nova Kirbani A. The planet is covered almost entirely with snow and ice, giving it a bright blue and white hue. While Orus's surface is believed to be uninhabitable, scientists haven't yet ruled out the possibility of subsurface pockets of water, some of which could be habitable for life as we know it.
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Orus_BiomeName1 = Northern Polarcap

		#LOC_GU_Planets_Orus_BiomeName9 = Fractured Terrain

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Ud.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Ud_displayName = Ud^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Ud_description = Ud is a small asteroid moon in a strange orbit around Orus. Current popular theory is that the asteroid was captured into an orbit around Orus fairly recently. As a result, the moon has an eccentric orbit that dips inside Ile's, along with a high inclination. While the moon is a bit difficult to reach, it makes a great location for a surface outpost and for studies on the formation of the Nova Kirbani System.
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Ud_BiomeName1 = Lowlands
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Ud_BiomeName2 = Midlands
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Ud_BiomeName3 = Highlands

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Ile.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Ile_displayName = Ile^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Ile_description = Ile is the larger and closer of Orus's two moons. It is believed that Ile is the remains of a past destabilization of larger moons that no longer exist. Because Ile is the sole remnant of Orus's potentially violent past, it makes a great place to learn about the history of Orus.
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Ile_BiomeName1 = Lowlands

		#LOC_GU_Planets_Ile_BiomeName6 = Giant Impactbasin

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Kaith.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Kaith_displayName = Kaith^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Kaith_description = Kaith is regarded among the scientific community as one of the most challenging planets to explore. Not only is it so massive, it's also ridiculously close to Nova Kirbani B, making it not only a challenge to reach but also to do anything within the orbit. The planet's close proximity to Nova Kirbani B also had led to its scorched nature, with massive lava seas that fry any kerbal wishing to take a swim. Despite all the challenges just to survive a mission here, Kaith is a popular destination among those who like to live life on the edge.
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Kaith_BiomeName1 = Lava
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Kaith_BiomeName2 = Substellar Hotspot
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Kaith_BiomeName3 = Hotspot

		#LOC_GU_Planets_Kaith_BiomeName6 = Volcanic Midlands
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Kaith_BiomeName6 = Volcanic Highlands

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Cail.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Cail_displayName = Cail^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Cail_description = Cail is the scorched, small world that is being incinerated by Nova Kirbani B. Although the world lacks an atmosphere, its close proximity to Nova Kirbani B causes a lot of tidal stress, making it a very chaotic planet in the Nova Kirbani System.
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Cail_BiomeName1 = BigScar
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Cail_BiomeName2 = Cratered Highlands
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Cail_BiomeName3 = Cratered Midlands

		#LOC_GU_Planets_Cail_BiomeName6 = Poles

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Syro.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Syro_displayName = Syro^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Syro_description = The nature of Syro has always stumped scientists through all of history. Some are convinced that the planet used to be much more like Kerbin before heating up to current temperatures. Others believe that Syro has always been a harsh, volcanic world that just lost all volcanic activity over time. The debate over Syro's formation has been intense since the planet's discovery. Either way, the planet's volcanoes are a very interesting sight, especially the massive caldera on the southern hemisphere.
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Syro_BiomeName1 = Volcano
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Syro_BiomeName2 = Giant Impact Basin

		#LOC_GU_Planets_Syro_BiomeName8 = Lava
		
		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Tur.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Tur_displayName = Tur^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Tur_description = Due to Tur's close orbit to Syro, this little moon has some violent features. Tidal stress has caused the moon to quite literally break in half, creating a large canyon that stretches across the entire planet. Not only is it a great place to learn about the history of Syro, but it also provides an amazing view of the planet, as well.
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Tur_BiomeName1 = Polar Regions

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Setha.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Setha_displayName = Setha^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Setha_description = Setha appears to be a boring moon, but it has a few interesting properties. The moon is covered in a rusty-looking dust and doesn't appear very interesting. However, this small moon has a large, deep crater. The moon is also believed to be a great outpost location due to its low gravity and ease of access.
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Setha_BiomeName1 = Lowlands

		#LOC_GU_Planets_Setha_BiomeName8 = Polar Regions

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Elno.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Elno_displayName = Elno^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Elno_description = Planet Elno is the last planet of the Nova Kirbani B system. It formed too far away from the habitable zone of the star and froze into an icy tundra that covers the entire globe. Snowstorms and bitter winds race across the surface, making the planet a good place to catch a cold.  In the far future, however, the habitable zone may extend outward enough for Elno to become habitable. Just maybe.
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Elno_BiomeName1 = Northern Polarcap

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Anuq.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Anuq_displayName = Anuq^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Anuq_description = Anuq is the sole, small moon of Elno. While it appears similar to Elno, preliminary research suggests that the moon didn’t form anywhere near the planet. The current theory is that Anuq used to be a large dwarf planet orbiting either Nova Kirbani B or even around both stars. Anuq also makes a great spot for simple bases, as it has the lowest gravity of any of the worlds around Nova Kirbani B.
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Anuq_BiomeName1 = Lowlands
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Anuq_BiomeName2 = Midlands

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Iro.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Iro_displayName = Iro^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Iro_description = Iro is a surprisingly two-faced planet. Being so close to Proksimus Kirbani, this little planet is tidally locked, meaning only one side of the planet faces the star at all times. This has led to Iro's two-sided appearance. The side facing Proksimus Kirbani is subject to intense volcanic activity, leading to a pizza-like appearance and a dark lava sea. The dark side of Iro is covered almost entirely in ice, as it's so cold that the ice can stay frozen, despite the close proximity to Proksimus Kirbani. Iro is a great planet to not only learn about tidally locked planets, but also Proksimus itself!
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Iro_BiomeName1 = Molten Sea
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Iro_BiomeName2 = Sulfuric Plains

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Narath.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Narath_displayName = Narath^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_NarathALT_displayName = Naralth^N
		
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Narath_description = Narath was the first world discovered in the Nova Kirbani System and a promising find due to its close distance to Kerbin and position in Proksimus Kirbani's habitable zone. It wasn't until much later surveys of the planet that found that while extremophile life may exist, Narath might not be as hospitable to kerbals as previously suspected. Its high gravity combined with a thin atmosphere makes it a difficult destination to land in. However, the planet is abundant in resources, making it suitable place for colonization in the Proksimus Kirbani system. <color=#ffb765>Narath is a hypothetical habitable analogue for Proxima b.</color>

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Sian.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Sian_displayName = Sian^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Sian_description = Sian is a large ice world orbiting on the outer skirts of Proksimus Kirbani's habitable zone. Despite its location, some scientists believe the planet could have formed as an ocean world, and cooled over millions or even billions of years. Others believe that the planet has always been frozen, but supports a liquid subsurface that will occasionally heat up the surface to allow for glaciation to occur. Either way, if Sian's subsurface ocean exists, so could the possibility of life.

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Elius.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Elius_displayName = Elius^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Elius_description = Elius was the last planet discovered around Proksimus Kirbani due to its sheer distance, despite being the largest planet in the Nova Kirbani System. The planet is believed to be only one in the system made primarily of gas. Elius plays a large role in the Proksimus Kirbani System as a shepherd and deflector of debri in the system and protector from any interstellar visitors. <color=#ffb765>Elius is a hypothetical analogue for Proxima C.</color>

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Um.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Um_displayName = Um^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Um_description = Um is a small moon orbiting near Elius's outer sphere of influence. This little potato-shaped asteroid moon is likely a small piece of debri that was caught into an orbit around the gas giant. The prevailing theory is that Um was an asteroid around Proksimus Kirbani, but the idea of it being a captured interstellar visitor hasn't been ruled out either.

		//GU/Celestials/02_System.NovaKirbani/Irnil.cfg
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Irnil_displayName = Irnil^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Irnil_description = The first moon of Elius, and likely the most geologically active. Tidal forces from its parent planet cause the moon's subsurface to behave as a molten core, leading to numerous geological features to form on the icy surface of the moon. Irnil is also host to some of the most spectacular geysers in the entire Nova Kirbani System, making it a great tourist destination.

		#LOC_GU_Planets_Nyss_displayName = Nyss^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Nyss_description = Nyss, although somewhat boring looking from space, is a unique moon of Elius. The planet used to be covered in a massive sheet of ice, but over time dust collected by Elius has coalesced on the surface of the moon. While the majority of Nyss looks greyish orange and dusty, there are patches of exposed ice from the subsurface that could even contain the ingredients for life.

		#LOC_GU_Planets_Mork_displayName = Mork^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Mork_description = Mork is the first dwarf planet discovered outside Kerbolar's sphere of influence. Orbiting in a resonance with Blalo and Orus, Mork doesn't appear to be a very interesting world, given its dull grey appearance and numerous craters, traits common among worlds without atmospheres. However, Mork is part of a binary with its moon Lark. Binary orbits are not common among worlds larger than asteroids, making Mork an interesting destination.

		#LOC_GU_Planets_Lark_displayName = Lark^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Lark_description = Lark is the sole 'moon' of Mork. Despite Lark being a large asteroid in normal circumstances, its large mass relative to Mork make the two a binary dwarf planet. Lark's low gravity and orbital resonance with Orus and Blalo make the binary a great pit stop for smaller craft trying to make their way to Orus.
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Surk_descriptionALT = Although there are asteroids and comets orbiting Alpha Centauri B, Surk stands out because of it's relative big size compared to other comets. Scientists agree this comet's orbit is perfect for sightseeing the entire system.

		#LOC_GU_Planets_Neid_displayName = Neid^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Neid_description = Neid is the sole moon of Sian, which wasn't discovered until very recently due to its small size and close proximity to the planet. It is believed that Neid might be the remnants of a large impact on Sian millions of years ago. Along with science opportunities, Neid is guaranteed impressive views of Sian, along with a nice ease of access to set up a small transport base.
