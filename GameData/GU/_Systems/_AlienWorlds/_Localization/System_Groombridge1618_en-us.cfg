		#LOC_GU_Stars_Groombridge1618_displayName = Glowridge 1618^N
		#LOC_GU_Stars_Groombridge1618_description = Glowridge 1618 is a solitary K-type star roughly 15.88 light years from Kerbol. It is 67% of the mass of the sun, is completely solitary, lacking any stellar or planetary companions. A gas giant greater than 4 Jool masses was suspected, but despite repeated attempts to find this body, none were conclusive. Perhaps a closer search might be warranted? <color=#ffb765>Analogous to Groombridge 1618.</color>

       		#LOC_GU_Planets_Hetoo_displayName = Hetoo^N
		#LOC_GU_Planets_Hetoo_description = Scientists are baffled at surface conditions on planet Hetoo. On one hand, the planet is inhabited by extremophile plant life. On the other hand, the planet is covered in toxic chlorine gas and possesses extreme geological activity. The only thing we know for sure about it is that it's definitely not made out of lime jell-o, contrary to popular belief.
