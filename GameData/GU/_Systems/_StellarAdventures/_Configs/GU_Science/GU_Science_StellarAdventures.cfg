@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{

		SgrAInSpaceHigh = You're surprised that none of the materials aren't being ripped out of the bay, but then remember that real life doesn't work like the movies and black holes are just massive objects and not big space vacuums.

		TheOrbInSpaceLow = The bay's computer seems to have gone haywire. It either went rogue, or something is trying to hack into it.
		TheOrbFlyingHigh = Significant portions of the bay have shorted out. You're not sure if it can generate any usable data without restoration or a hard reset.
		TheOrbFlyingLow = Significant portions of the bay have shorted out. You're not sure if it can generate any usable data without restoration or a hard reset.
		TheOrbSrfLanded = The bay fails to communicate the usual data, but you do seem to be getting other sets of data. However, you have no way to interpret them, making whatever you're hearing useless.
