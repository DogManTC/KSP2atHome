Textures were created by StarCrusher96 with the use of Adobe Photoshop from various online sources, sattelite images and cloudtexture libraries. However they're edited to serve the purpose of GU and therefore fall under the mod's license and NO permission is given to use this content for other purposes other than Galaxies Unbound.

- detail_IPayedForThisOne is a bought texture (and pretty expensive). 
- Clouds_05 to Clouds_10 are bought assets. 
- Clouds_01 to Clouds_03 are made from online free sources, tho they are edited and therefore fall under GU's license.
- All details are handmade.
