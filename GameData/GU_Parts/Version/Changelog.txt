* Added reactor power switch to engines: 100%, 25%, 5%. Requires B9PS.
* Adjusted some parts' positions in CTT, added positions in Kiwi tech tree.

  * ICF part (1/3 thrust plus 2.25M Isp); 
* Adjusted SRX Vernier: Is now an MPDT, uses LH2 + lots of EC.

  * Inferior antenna works up to exactly within Nova Kirbani. (Was previously infinitely OP.)
  * Superior antenna works up to 1.6x the distance to Nova Kirbani.
* Localization pass: 
  * All tanks titles now start with "GU, not PB/ISV", all tags added/fixed, descriptions WIP update.
